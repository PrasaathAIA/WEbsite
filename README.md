# Website

A simple static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a static file server to serve the site.

## Running the Backend

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with the required values
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   or, if a start script is defined:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server serves the static files and handles form submissions.
